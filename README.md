# ET Hackathon AI Agent

Welcome to **et-hackathon-ai-agent** 👋 — an AI-powered agent project built for the ET AI Hackathon. This repository contains a full-stack implementation of a smart agent system designed to assist with intelligent tasks like job hunting, task automation, or decision-making workflows using AI.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is an AI agent system that combines **backend APIs** with a **modern frontend UI** to deliver intelligent agent behavior — such as interacting with users, executing tasks, and retrieving information via AI models.

> ⚙️ Built as part of a hackathon initiative to showcase autonomous AI capabilities.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧩 Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

💻 Frontend Setup

Go to the frontend folder:

cd frontend


Install dependencies:

npm install


Run dev server:

npm run dev


Open your browser:

http://localhost:3000

⚡ Usage

Once both backend and frontend are running:

Open the UI in your browser

Interact with the AI agent via the UI

Watch API calls hit your backend

Backend forwards requests to the configured AI model/provider

🔧 You can extend the agent logic to support new tools, workflows, or AI models.

🧪 Examples

Here are some example prompts you can try:

• “Find the top remote AI jobs for me”
• “Summarize the latest tech trends”
• “Draft an email to my manager”
